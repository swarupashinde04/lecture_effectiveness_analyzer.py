The effectiveness score is calculated using a weighted model:
Interaction level (50%)
Lecture duration suitability (30%)
Student alertness (20%)
Key Features
Clean, function-based design
Input validation for reliable results
Clear and interpretable output
Technologies
Python (functions, conditionals, input handling)
Future Scope
Can be extended with data visualization, historical analysis, and additional engagement parameters.
