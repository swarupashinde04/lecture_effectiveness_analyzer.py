# Lecture Effectiveness Analyzer

## Problem

In traditional classrooms, lecture quality is often judged subjectively. There is no simple way to quantify how effective a lecture was based on student experience.

## Solution

This project analyzes lecture effectiveness using three key factors:

* **Lecture Duration**
* **Student Interaction Level**
* **Student Sleepiness Level**

It converts these inputs into a numerical effectiveness score (0–100%) along with clear qualitative feedback.

## Core Logic

* An optimal lecture duration (45–60 minutes) receives the highest score.
* Interaction has the highest weight as it directly impacts learning.
* Sleepiness is inversely related to effectiveness.
* A weighted scoring formula is used to ensure smooth and realistic evaluation.

## Output

* **Effectiveness Percentage**
* **Actionable Feedback** (Highly Effective / Moderate / Needs Improvement)

## Tech Stack

* Python
* Basic mathematical modeling
* Console-based input/output

## Why This Project?

This project demonstrates:

* Logical thinking
* Data-driven evaluation
* Clean function-based Python programming

Designed as an academic analytics mini-tool suitable for first-year research exposure.
